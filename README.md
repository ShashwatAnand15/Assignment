# Assignment
 We have used the standard HTML Drag and Drop to create this game of sorting numbers.
 
 We have created 10 droppable objects where 5 are the resultant droppable blocks where user will have to drop the numbers.
 
 When user have filled all the 5 blocks then Check Answer button will appear.
 
 When user clicks on Check Answer button then it will show user whether answer is correct or wrong.
 
 User can click on Refresh Page to restart the Game.
 
 
 Inorder to implement above feature we have created different functions in the index.js file for dragenter , dragover , dragleave and drop.
